               What is Server Co-location?</h3>
             <p>
               Co-location option allows webmasters to exercise total control over their Internet
               server. We will place your server on our premises and will permit you to make use
               of our bandwidth and facilities. You retain complete control over your equipment,
               software and operating system and will be simply leasing the physical space, and
               high-grade, tier one network access, from us.
             </p>
             <p>
               You require an Internet Server, and are solely responsible for pre-loading it with
               both the operating system and web server software that you desire. With co-location,
               we allocate your server: rack space, an Ethernet connection and IP numbers, as required.
               We provide you with an open (i.e. no bandwidth limitations) connection to our FE100
               100 Mbps fibre connection.

             What is Dedicated Hosting?</h3>
           <p>
             Dedicated hosting permits individuals and business to lease pre-configured, state-of-the-art
             equipment and connectivity from us. Instead of simply sharing server space on a
             virtual server, this service gives you the opportunity to lease an entire server
             for your own exclusive use.
           </p>
           <p>
             With a dedicated server, you can exercise total control over your Web presence.
             You can choose the operating system and software you wish to use, and individualize
             settings for your multimedia and e-commerce requirements. This is a good choice
             for customers that require custom software or enhanced server control but do not
             want to make the significant up-front investment required in purchasing and housing
             their own server.

             After establishing the project, a business must define how it is going to market
             its website. One of the biggest fallacies in establishing a website is the notion
             that, "if you build it, they will come." It takes continued promotions, both off
             and on-line, to build any meaningful traffic to a site.

             "Providing Master Databanks"</h3>
           <p>
             Microsoft MS SQL/ASP.Net is available as an option with a Windows website hosting
             account. An MS SQL database backend used with VB/JAVA scripting is a tried and tested
             web designer's favorite for building dynamic websites. The MySQL/PHP combination
             is also ideally suited to solving those problems posed by website designs that are
             not scalable, maintainable or technically feasible using the conventional HTML authoring
             techniques. MySQL provides a fast, reliable and easy-to-use database solution that
             is ideal for retrieving product information and storing customer information. PHP
             is a server-side HTML-embedded scripting language equivalent to Microsoft's Active
             Server Pages on the Windows NT platform. It is the ideal tool for database integration,
             and it is widely used in combination with MySQL, Windows NT ODBC.
           </p>
           <p>
             An ODBC or Open Database Connectivity (additional cost) data source allows you to
             use SQL queries to connect to an uploaded database file. Querying a database via
             ODBC is simple. SQL statements can be embedded into your Active Server Pages, with
             the query being executed when the page is requested. The output of the query can
             then be used to create the Web page.
           </p>
           <p>
             If you want your website to deliver excellent customer service and enable your customers
             to be able to search intuitively for your products, a database will become a vital
             component of your online strategy.
           </p>

             Improve Customer Service
           </h3>
           <p>
             Purchasing products and services can often be complex and frustrating experience.
             A database allows you to publish your products/services online and make searching
             and selecting easy for your customers. The speed and simplicity a database provides,
             can improve customer satisfaction and retain online customers.
           </p>
           <h3 class="Blue AbtM_Top">
             Automate Customer Interaction</h3>
           <p>
             A database automates much of the interaction that takes place when a customer buys
             a product, thus reducing the amount of time you need to spend answering telephonic
             queries.
           </p>
           <h3 class="Blue AbtM_Top">
             Increase Profitability</h3>
           <p>
             Whether trading online or not, your product/service can be far more accessible with
             a database-driven website. Improved customer satisfaction, reduced telephone sales
             and administration costs can make your business more profitable.</p>
           <h3 class="Blue AbtM_Top">
             Achieve Customer Focused E-Commerce</h3>
           <p>
             According to forecasts by independent research groups, e-commerce will create more
             than Â£200 billion worth of transactions annually by the year 2002, compared to Â£6
             billion in 1997. To take advantage of this burgeoning market, businesses need fast,
             efficient, and highly reliable e-commerce websites. A critical component of this
             is a database that stores product and customer information and allows customers
             to search and select your products intuitively.</p>
